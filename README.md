# Auto-Tagging-System

## Problem Statement

The project deals with how to develop tags for the given text. For example, on a stackoverflow question page, title and description are mentioned and below are the tags. Now there are 100s of thousands of questions and it may not be possible for domain experts to read and then answer them individually. To address this issue, tags comes into the picture.

In the above picture , we can see the title, description and tags. Through tags, we can have an idea what the question is about.The tags and number of tags can be different for different texts. In this project we will build an auto tagging system that will automatically generate the tags for the given texts.

We will be using F1 score as a Performance metric for this problem. F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall values.

#### Precision
It is defined as ratio of true positives by (true positives + false positives)

#### Recall 
It is defined as ratio of true positives by (true positives + false negatives)

#### F1 Score = 2* Precision * Recall / (Precision + Recall)
