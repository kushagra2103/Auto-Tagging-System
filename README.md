# Auto-Tagging-System

## Problem Statement

The project deals with how to develop tags for the given text. For example, on a stackoverflow question page, title and description are mentioned and below are the tags. Now there are 100s of thousands of questions and it may not be possible for domain experts to read and then answer them individually. To address this issue, tags comes into the picture.

In the above picture , we can see the title, description and tags. Through tags, we can have an idea what the question is about.The tags and number of tags can be different for different texts. In this project we will build an auto tagging system that will automatically generate the tags for the given texts. It is a mulitlabel classification problem.  


## Dataset

We will be using F1 score as a Performance metric for this problem. F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall values.

#### Precision
It is defined as ratio of true positives by (true positives + false positives)

#### Recall 
It is defined as ratio of true positives by (true positives + false negatives)

#### F1 Score = 2* Precision * Recall / (Precision + Recall) 

## Text Cleaning and Pre Processing

First major step is to clean the data. It contains variou html and urls links, punctuations, single letter alphabets and stopwords which dosent convey much information regarding what topics they are related to. 

Steps are as follows.

1. Combining the title and text part of our dataset.

2. Removing all the punctuations, alphabets through the regex and white spaces and stopwords 

3. Finally lowercasing all the words present in the text.

4. Reshaping our target variable(tag). Since they are 100 , we will be apply MultiLableBinarizer for sckit learn library. 100 columns more will be more in palce of one.

5. Applying Tfidf vectorizer over the text_cleaned part of our dataset having max_features= 10000 (keping only 10000 top words) and max_df=0.8 (words appearing in more than 80 % of text are removed) and Word2Vec model (keeping number of features = 100 initially and then varying) for feature engineering 

6. Splitting the data using train_test_split using sklearn.model_selection library in 80/20 ratio and then using the logistic regression for prediction. 

## Feature Engineering 

### TFIDF: Term frequency and Inverse Document Frequency 

Tf-Idf stands for term frequency inverse document frequency. Term Frequency summarizes how often a given word appears within a document and Inverse Document Frequency downscales words that appear a lot across documents. Tfidf scores are the product of these two terms. Without inverse document term, words which appear more common (that carries little information) would be weighed higher and words appearing rare(which contains more information) would be weighed less.

Inverse document frequency is defined as:

idf(t,D)=log (N/ |d∈D:t∈d|)

Where N is the total number of documents (questions) in the corpus, and |d∈D:t∈d| is the number of documents where t appears

A vecotizer object is created by calling the TfidfVectorizer class. Some arguments for it are as follows.

max_features = 1000, it meanns we want only 1000 words to decribe the context of the given question 

max_df= 0.8, it means removing those words which have appeared in more than 80 % of the questions

Tfidf matrix has a shape of 76365* 1000 where 76365 is the number of the questions and 1000 is the number of features describing that question.

In the above snapshot the maxtrix , value address the importance of the word to that question. High value means more importance. We can increase the max_features but too much of 0 values will make it more sparse and computalionally expensive. We can tweak it around a bit and see the change when trying to fit the model. 


### Word2Vec Word Embeddings 

Word2vec is a group of related models that are used to produce word embeddings. These models are shallow, two-layer neural networks that are trained to reconstruct linguistic contexts of words. Word2vec takes as its input a large corpus of text and produces a vector space, typically of several hundred dimensions, with each unique word in the corpus being assigned a corresponding vector in the space. Word vectors are positioned in the vector space such that words that share common contexts in the corpus are located close to one another in the space. There are two models for generating the embeddings, CBOW(Continous Bag of words) and skip gram model. CBOW is used for small corpus, it is fast but for larger corpus skip gram is better, takes a little more time than CBOW. Here skip gram is used, below its explanation.

#### Skip Gram 
It is used to get the word embeddings matrix for the words present in our corpus. It tries to predict the context given the word. So given the window size of 2, two words before and two after are predicted for the given word. 

![2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36281158/87121435-5bdd3100-c2a0-11ea-9794-2ef4b3d8cb0a.PNG)

Skip Gram is a two layer network where the weight matrix of the hidden layer is calculated. First the vocabulary is contructed where each unique word in the corpus is indexed. Then all the words are one-hot encoded. Training examples are created as depicted below. Pairs are selected for each word given window size is 2. For a given word, 4 pairs will exits. If there is suppose 10,000 words vocabulary and 300 features, then given word is taken as an input to the network and output is output is a 10000 * 1 matrix where it contains probability values of all the words in vocab. So for each training example , corresponding words for the "given input word", their probablity values should be maximized and due to backpropogation , errors are minimzed and weights are updated. In the end, weight matrix obatained for the hidden layer (10,000 * 300) is the embedding matrix. This matrix is based on statistics on how much two words have appeared together or are close in the corpus. One close to the given word will have high probability values and one far away will have low probability value. To get the embedding of the given word, just multiply the one hot encoding vector of it with the hidden matrix layer.

![4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36281158/87122804-36055b80-c2a3-11ea-9079-1c5574eb3a98.PNG)

Here, the number of features have been tweaked from 50 to 500 to see the change in the accuracy. Word2Vec model is being trained on the corpus of ~59000 words using the "Gensim" library. Also for the words, "value", "stastitics", "algorithm" are plotted in a 2D space (being 100 dimensional vectors) using PCA dimesionality reduction technique. Below is the projection. 

![6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36281158/87123485-73b6b400-c2a4-11ea-93c0-cd5a77cf050f.PNG)


## Fitting the model 

We will use the OneVsRestclassifier model (with logistic regression in it ) to fit over the training data as it calculates over the 100 tags simultaneously. Also the words having probabilities > 0.45 have been assigned 1 and 0 vice cersa. 

### Using the TFIDF model 
F1 score comes out to be 0.45. On changing the max features, score dosent seems to change much. 

### Using the Word2Vec model 
Here, i have tweaked the number of features; 50-500, values and their scores as follows, (50,100,300,500) -> (0.32,0.36,0.41,0.42). Plotting the graph we can see that increasing it further would not improve the score much.

#### Prediticting on the new data set :

text ="Regression line in ggplot doesn't match computed regression Im using R and created a chart using ggplot2. I then create a regression so I can make some predicitions I pass my data frame of to the predict function predict(regression, Measures) I'd expect the predictions to be the same as if I used the regression line on the chart, but they aren't the same. Why would this be the case? Is there a setting in ggplot or is my expectation incorrect?" 

Using TFidf, it predicts 2 out of three tags : 'r', 'regression'   

'ggplot' is missing



Tried Gaussian Naive byes algorithm for both the above models but it was giving very poor results. 

Some further improvements which may improve the score as follows.

1. More Training data 

2. For Word2Vec model, negative sampling appraoch can be taken as it will reduce the computation time (as it takes into account less number of training examples)

3. Using pre trained word embeddings  

4. Trying different classification algorithms for multi label classification 


## Using CNN based Deep Learning model

Theory Behind the CNN based architecture for classification

Below is the structure of the CNN based deep learning structure 


![8](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36281158/87391788-028b3f80-c5c9-11ea-95d1-a7df68cc11ba.PNG)

### How the model works ?

The sentence shown " I like this movie very much !" is passed through an embedding layer where each word gets an embedding vector of its own of size "d". The filter sizes shown are of 2,3 and 4. Filter of size "2" means that it will slide over two words and tries to capture the information in words pair. Here the CNN structure is 1D becasue we slide along the vertical direction as here the number of dimensions in word embeddings ("d") is equal to the filter width. These filter weights (10 in case of 2 * 5 filter in the figure, they are initialized) are the parameters which are obtained through loss function. Each filter is slided over the sentence; with weight multiplied over the word vectors, valued obtained is passed through an activation function and then stored in an output format which has same number of rows as input and width=1. This process is called convulation, meaning the large input size is reduced with having only important information in the form of smaller matrix. Then it is repeated across all the filter sizes and then across each output matrix (feature maps), in case of Global Max pooling the maximum value is taken from each and joined further which will act as an input (single feature vector)  to the final output softmax layer where it classifies it further into pre determined categories. Softmax is a sigmoid function which will compute the probability for each class (values ranging between 0 and 1). Here the Global max Pooling means we are extracting the most useful information, sometimes average pooling is used which means we are taking into all the information stored.  

#### Strucuture of our model 

##### 1. Embedding Layer 

First the documents (text) in our data are being tokenized. Then the input lenght is defined. Padding is a procedure where if a document size is less than input length defined, then it is padded to get it the same length as that of defined one. For documents having the size greater than the input length , they are trimmed. Now with having the input length defined, all the sequences are fed to the embedding layer. Here we can choose what dimensions our output can have, generally it is choosen between 64, 128, 256, 512. When all the sequences are fed, word embeddings are generated. Parameters to this layer is lenght of the vocabulary (number of the unique words), output dimension and input length.

Total number of trainable parameters are calculated as vocab size * output dimensions (weight matrix to get the embedding). To reduce overfitting, a dropout rate is applied having 0 learning parameter

##### 2. Conv1D layer 

Here the filters are applied over the output from the embedding layer. The number of trainable parameters  is equal to ((filter size * output dimension * previous filter size)+1) * number of filters. Output we get is called as feature matrix. Total of 300 filters are choosen, activation function choosen is "Relu"

##### 3. GLobal Max Pool 1D

Max pooling is applied. For every filter, we will get one value which will be the maximum one among the all, so its size will be (number of filters * 1). No learning parameters are used.  

##### 4. Dense Layer 

Output feature matrix after globalmax pooling is fed to dense layer (having number of neurons equal to number of categories). So number of parameters to be trained here are weights ; let say the number of neurons in dense layer is n and output matrix from previous step have shape be x * 1. So number of trainalbe parameters are equal to ( x * n ) + 1 * ) n. Activation function choosen in sigmoid. 

Steps: 

1. First tokenize the text. In this way every document will be converted into a sequence of words identified by their token number. To do this, we will use Tokenizer from keras.preprocessing.text. 

![11](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36281158/87498197-d3320c80-c674-11ea-9996-af8e1369f1b3.PNG)

  Lenght of our vocab comes out to be 81957. 

2. After tokenization, we will define the input length for the embedding layer. Here we will calculate the length at variosu percentiles. Input length of 125 is chosen. We can change if we want. Then after defining the input lenght , we will pad the sequences

Percentile v/s Length

30th percentile:  97.0

40th percentile:  116.0

50th percentile:  137.0

60th percentile:  162.0

70th percentile:  193.0

80th percentile:  238.0

90th percentile:  320.0

95th percentile:  411.0

99th percentile:  678.0

3. Reshaping our target variable same as done in above and splitting the dataset in 80/ 20 ratio 

4. We will build our model by adding the embedding layer , Conv1D layer, GlobalMax Pool 1D, Dense Layer.

5. Compile the model using "adam" optimizer, loss='binary_crossentropy' and "accuracy" as a metric. 

Adam : It is most widely used optimizer; it is a combination of RMS prop and momentum which are used to accelerate the gradient descent

Cross Entropy Binary Loss: It computes the loss by treating every class(eg, 100 here ) as a binary classification problem

6. Here is the model summary 

![12](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36281158/87611651-3039cb00-c726-11ea-995b-7931705664da.PNG)

Parametes calculation :

vocab size = 81957 

Embedding layer: 81957 * 128  = 10490496. So it providing the embedding matrix, here the number of the parameters are the weights in the matrix 

conv1d_1 (Conv1D) : ((3* 128 * 1) + 1) * 300 = 115500 where the 3 is the filter size, 128 is the output dimension of the embedding layer, 1 is the added for the "bias" 

dense_1 (Dense) : (300* 100) + 1* 100 = 30100 where 300 is the dimesnion after global max pooling, 100 is the final output layer # neurons , 1 is for bias term for every output neuron which would be classifying for 100 tags 

7. Model Training :

epochs=10, batch_size=512, validation_split=0.1, callbacks=callbacks

Epochs: Number of the passes through the entire training set
batch_size: 512: number of the training in examples in one batch 
validation_split=0.1, means 10 % of the training data will be reserved for checking whether the model is overfitting or not. 
callbacks: In one of its parameters EarlyStopping, patience is set to 3, it means if the loss computed is not decreasing after 3 iterations, it will stop

### Performance of the model

It gives an F1 score of 0.49 which is more than that of previous models. 

On the new data: 

"Regression line in ggplot doesn't match computed regression Im using R and created a chart using ggplot2. I then create a regression so I can make some predicitions I pass my data frame of to the predict function predict(regression, Measures) I'd expect the predictions to be the same as if I used the regression line on the chart, but they aren't the same. Why would this be the case? Is there a setting in ggplot or is my expectation incorrect?"

It predicts regression, ggplot and R as the tags which is more accurate than prevous model


#### Suggestions on futher improving the model:

1. More data

2. Instead of filter size 3, we can change it or we can have three seperate layers of filter sizes 3, 4 and 5 and then combining them or we can change the number of filters for each size

3. We can change the strucuture of our model by adding more Conv1D layers, or more dense layers
